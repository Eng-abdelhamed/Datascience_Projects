#  Data Science Projects During My DEPI Scholarship

Welcome! This repository showcases the **Data Science Life Cycle** as applied during my DEPI Scholarship through various projects. Each project follows a structured process from data gathering to deployment and monitoring.

---

##  Data Science Life Cycle

### 1. 📥 Data Gathering
Collect data from diverse sources such as:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

---

### 2. 🧠 Data Understanding
- Understand the **domain context** of the dataset.
- Analyze the **problem statement** and the **goal**.
- Identify key questions: *What is the data telling us? What do we want to predict or understand?*

---

### 3. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handle **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **outliers**.
- Apply data **normalization** and **transformation**.
- Ensure clean, consistent, and usable data for modeling.

---

### 4. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore **data patterns**, **distributions**, and **correlations**.
- Identify **trends**, **anomalies**, and **insights**.
- Tools used: `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`.

---

### 5. 📊 Data Visualization
- Present data insights in a **visual format** for better understanding.
- Create **charts**, **graphs**, and **dashboards** for stakeholders.
- Emphasize **clarity**, **impact**, and **actionable insights**.

---

### 6. 🔧 Feature Engineering
- Select the most **relevant features** for the model.
- Create new features to **enhance model performance**.
- Techniques: **Encoding**, **Scaling**, **Feature Selection**, **Polynomial Features**.

---

### 7. 🤖 Modeling
- Choose appropriate **machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Train, validate, and **tune hyperparameters**.
- Tools used: `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`.

---

### 8. 🧪 Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using metrics:
  - Classification: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**
  - Regression: **RMSE**, **MAE**, **R² Score**
- Perform **cross-validation** for reliability.

---

### 9. 🚀 Deployment
- Deploy the trained model as a **production-ready product**.
- Tools & frameworks:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

---

### 10. 🛡️ Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Monitor performance** post-deployment.
- Handle **model drift** and **update** with new data.
- Gather **feedback** and ensure **continuous improvement**.
